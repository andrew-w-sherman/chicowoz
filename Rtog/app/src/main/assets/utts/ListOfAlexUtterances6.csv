,I think probably high so that there's more rooms to make the beams really big,,I think probably high so that it's more rooms to make the beams really big,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think that might make it stronger…,,,,,"""Wait, can we",,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think that's going to work,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think the beams all need to connect to something though,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think the beams can go in the water because they like attach into the ground, um, under the water",,,,,"Explaining prosody, as if the kid just said ""WE CAN'T PUT BEAMS INTO THE WATER IDIOT""",,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think the beams need to touch the ground,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,I think the middle beam maybe helps it be like strong all the way across,,I think the middle beam maybe help it be like strong all the way across,verbalS,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think the side beams are strongest if they're like… triangle shaped.,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,If it's taller then maybe we need more support beams? So it's more sturdy?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think... lots of blocks on the bottom of the beams and then less blocks on the top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think we should give it a really strong base,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think we should put more blocks near the base so the beams are really strong,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not said like a brat though - kind of almost like it's humbling. ""Oh, no big deal, I just played with legos a lot.""",,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I wonder… how we can make it stronger without making it taller…,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,If it's different though then will one side be stronger?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"If it's higher then, um, more blocks will be able to hold it up",,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,If it's too low though then the beams won't have room to have a lot of blocks,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"If we just add more bricks to the bottom of the across part, will that make it... stronger?",,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,It should be tall enough for that boat to go under I think,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It'll probably need a few, um, beams on both sides",,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"it's just um, extra weight I think... unless they're holding the beams together?",,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,It's not a bridge if it's not off the ground at all!,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,It's probably gonna be stronger with more beams,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Like a rectangle?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Like a triangle?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe it should have stairs,,,,,Playful kind of like a joke. ,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe it's gonna be stronger if it's thicker on the bottom,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe more blocks in the beams would make them stronger,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I don't even think those half-way beams are doing anything,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe they're fine in the water if they're thick enough so they don't get knocked down,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe we could make really big beams on both sides,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe we could make the base like really thick,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe we need more beams to make it stronger,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe we should make it lower so it has less room to wiggle around,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe we should make it taller so it's bigger and stronger,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,No beams at the top part?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What about that beam across the middle?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,one beam in the water?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,One beam or do you think more?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,People are gonna fall,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Shoud it be like... more than one level high? Like multi-level?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,So it can help support it,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,So the ground can help support it,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,So we're having a middle beam that goes across the whole thing?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,So what if we do just one beam in the water?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,So what if we do three beams in the water?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,That would be a wall!,,,,,"Playful, in case the kid says something like ""THE WHOLE BASE SHOULD JUST BE A BEAM""",,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think those beams have to be bigger to hold up those weights,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,They're probably gonna be stronger if they're bigger,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,three beams at the top part?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,three beams in the water?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Wait can the bricks even go like that?!,,,,,Playful,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Wait, at the top or at the bottom?",,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What about the boat?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,That's gonna break,,,,,"""Thaaaa'ts gonna break.""",,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What if it's too tall and it falls over?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What if we connect the water beams to the land beams?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Will the middle part be strong enough?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Would that make one side stronger than the other?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Yeah it's gonna crash,,,,,"Joke, in response to the kid being like ""omg the boat is going to diieeee"" or ""the boat is never gonna fit""",,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Well maybe the middle bar can help it by… umm….?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Well maybe more beams help… by… umm….?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Well maybe the bigger base at the bottom could help by… um…,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe if it's just straight up then it'll... take up less room?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,So you could have more beams then?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe if we make the beams little then we could have more?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Do you think it's better if we have more little beams or um, fewer thick beams?",,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Do you think it's better if we keep the top part flat or if we have more blocks on it?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe more blocks on the top can add extra strength,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,...Because it'll hold it together better?,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think there shouldn't be any extra weight to keep it strong,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think the people still need to walk across the top part,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think we need to figure out how to make sure the bridge isn't going to break when there's another weight bag on it,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,But we don't even know where they're gonna put the other bag…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,It looks like it's going to break even with just one bag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,My hypothesis is that the bridge will be strongest if we have strong beams on both sides and in the middle part,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"because I think then it will be… more stable, and the bridge won't break",,,,,,,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"My hypothesis is also that the way to make the beams stronger is to um, first to make them really thick, like with a lot of bricks on them.",,,,,,,1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,And the beams are also gonna be stronger if they're bigger at the base part… like a triangle,,,,,,,1,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,because then I think the base can make them more sturdy.,,,,,,,1,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,My other hypothesis is that the bridge would be even stronger if there were… supports connecting the middle part to the other beams.,,,,,,,1,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Because this way the beams probably won't break and the bridge can stay up.,,,,,,,1,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,And my last hypothesis is that there shouldn't be a lot of extra weight at the top…,,,,,,,1,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,… because if there's more weight at the top than at the bottom than it can crash…,,,,,,,1,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,… so I think that the top should be strong and there should be supports that hold it up…,,,,,,,1,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,… but that there shouldn't be extra blocks on top of it because that will just add more weight.,,,,,,,1,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,So yeah the bridge should have a lot of thick supports that are all connected to each other and to the middle part.,,,,,,,1,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,And... that's all.,,,,,,,1,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Probably money,,,,"joking, ""What do you think is in those bags? ""Probably money!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Okay… so I think we have to talk about making it stronger so it can hold up another one of those weight bags…,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW,Are those orange beams even doing anything?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,You think we need to make those orange ones longer?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think the orange blocks are just adding extra weight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Yeah, the orange ones?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,the pink one or the red one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,that blue one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What about that blue one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe we could make those orange ones like connect to the purple one and then connect back to the ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"If they're like the whole way, then I think they could hold it up",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I wonder if the blue one connect to the gray, or just stop at the purple?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Looks like it can pass through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The red one looks strong, but the pink one doesn't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think the blue beam looks strong, but the orange beams don't",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The blue beam conneects the purple one to the water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think the beams are strong… if they connect to both the top of the bridge and the ground somehow…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Real bridges have like a zig-zag pattern sometimes I think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"it looks like the pink side beam has only one row, and the red beam has two rows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think the um, red and pink side beams should be bigger on the bottom so it can hold it up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe we need more of those blue beams to hold it up in the water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think we need more beams connecting the gray and the purple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,That pink one is probably gonna break with another weight on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,They're probably gonna put the other weight on the other side of that gray hill part,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe we should make the blue beam be thicker too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"If pink and red are different, then maybe it can like, use different types of strength? To hold it up?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Let's give the pink beam another row,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think we should add another row to the pink beam to make it the same as the red one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Do you think the red and pink beams should have the same number of blocks, or different?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What about the purple beam?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I don't even think it can stay up like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Is that gonna make it strong or just gonna add extra weight?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What about if we connect the orange ones to that purple one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think they want us to imagine that they can all stick together like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Is that purple beam even doing anything?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Should we keep the purple one in?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Well maybe the orange blocks could help make it stronger if we like… um….,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Maybe the red beam and the pink beam should have the same, um, number of blocks because…. Uh….",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Well maybe it's good if the pink and red are different because..um…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Maybe the blue beam could help make it stronger by…um…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Do you think the bridge is going to be stronger if we try and make it heavier?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think the extra gray blocks on top are just gonna be making it heavier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Do you think we should make the gray part flat all the way across, or keep the … pyramid on it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,hmm… I think we could make it stronger by… um...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
