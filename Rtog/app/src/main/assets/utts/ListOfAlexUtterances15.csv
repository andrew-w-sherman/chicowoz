RP48,"We had to figure out whether it should be high up or low, long or short, and if it was better to use a golf ball or tennis ball",Ramp,"We had to figure out whether it should be high up or low, long or short, and if it was better to use a golf ball or tennis ball"
RP49,How did you decide whether it should have been high or low?,Ramp,How did you decide whether it should have been high or low?
RP50,"I, um, imagined the ramp in real life, and what if would look like if I was really rolling these balls down it",Ramp,"I, um, imagine da ramp in real life, and what it would look like if I was really rollin these balls down it"
RP51,and why?,General,an why?
RP52,How did you decide which ball would be better?,Ramp,How did you decide which ball would be better?
RP53,Which ball do you think would go fastest on the ramp?,Ramp,Which ball do you think would go fastest on the ramp?
RP54,How could you make the ramp better?,Ramp,How could you make the ramp better?
RP55,Why is high up better?,Ramp,Why is high up better?
RP56,Why is long faster than short?,Ramp,Why is long faster than short?
RP57,I think long is fastest because it gives the ball more time to roll down the ramp and pick up speed,Ramp,I think long is fastest cuz it give the ball more time to roll down the ramp and pick up speed
RP58,I think long is especially good if the ramp is high up because then there's more gravity pulling it down,Ramp,I think long is specially good if da ramp is high up cuz den there's more gravity pullin it down
RP59,"I think the golf ball is better to use because it's smaller and heavier, so it can get pulled down by the gravity more",Ramp,"I think the golf ball is better to use because it's smaller and heavier, so it can get pulled down by the gravity more"
RP60,The fuzz on the tennis ball will probably slow it down and make it not go as fast,Ramp,Da fuzz on the tennis ball will prolly slow it down and make it not go as fast
RP61,Can you explain that um a little more clearly?,General,Can you explain that um a little more clear?

RP63,"I think if it had bigger teeth, it would be able to eat more animals better",Creature,"I fink if it got bigger teef, it be able to eat more animal better"
RP64,"If its legs were longer maybe, like they were straighter too, then I think he could run faster",Creature,"If it legs were more longer maybe, an like dey were straighter too, den I fink he could run faster"

RP66,What is an idea for how you could make the bridge stay up even if it was like really windy?,Bridge,What is an idea for how you could make the bridge stay up even if it was like real windy?
RP67,"I think if there was more weight on top, you'd have to make the top part even stronger, like by having more connecting pieces to support the middle from collapsing",Bridge,"I fink if dere was more weight on top, you'd gotta to make the top part even stronger, like by having more connecting pieces to support da middle from collapsing"
RP68,"Maybe if there was like supports on either side of it that connected up to the top of it, it wouldn't fall over Like  with a tent.",Bridge,"Maybe if there was like supports on either side of it that connected up to the top of it, it wouldn't fall over Like  with a tent."
RP69,Do you think a big or small race car would go down the ramp fastest?,Ramp,Do you think a big or small race car would go down the ramp mos fastest?
RP70,"I think the size of it wouldn't matter, as long as it was heavy  because I think the heavy one would be fastest",Ramp,"I think the size of it wouldn't matter, as long as it was heavy  because I think the heavy one would be fastest"
RP71,why?,General,why?
