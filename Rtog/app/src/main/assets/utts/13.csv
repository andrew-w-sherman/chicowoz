Do those middle beams need to go all the way down?
"Do we need more beams to um, hold it up better?"
Do you think it has to be the same on both sides?
"Do you think it should be um, high up or low?"
Do you think that would be strong enough?
Do you think that'll help them stay up?
Do you think that's gonna make it too heavy?
What about those half-way supports? By the top?
I don't think that one would work
I think the bridge is going to fall over over if it's too high up
"if it's different, then maybe different types of strength can hold it up"
I think that might make it stronger�
I think that's going to work
I think the beams all need to connect to something though
"I think the beams can go in the water because they like attach into the ground, um, under the water"
I think the beams need to touch the ground
I think the beams should be really thick
I think the side beams are strongest if they're like� triangle shaped.
If it's taller then maybe we need more support beams? So it's more sturdy?
I think... lots of blocks on the bottom of the beams and then less blocks on the top
I think we should give it a really strong base
I think we should put more blocks near the base so the beams are really strong
"I think we should try to make it equal, um, amounts of strong across the whole bridge"
I wonder� how we can make it stronger without making it taller�
If it's different though then will one side be stronger?
"If it's higher then, um, more blocks will be able to hold it up"
If it's too low though then the beams won't have room to have a lot of blocks
"Maybe if there's too many blocks on top, those beams are gonna break"
"If we just add more bricks to the bottom of the across part, will that make it... stronger?"
It should be tall enough for that boat to go under I think
"It'll probably need a few, um, beams on both sides"
"it's just um, extra weight I think... unless they're holding the beams together?"
It's not a bridge if it's not off the ground at all!
It's probably gonna be stronger with more beams
Like a rectangle?
Like a triangle?
Maybe it should have stairs
Maybe it's gonna be stronger if it's thicker on the bottom
Maybe more blocks in the beams would make them stronger
I don't even think those half-way beams are doing anything
Maybe they're fine in the water if they're thick enough so they don't get knocked down
Maybe we could make really big beams on both sides
Maybe we could make the base like really thick
Maybe we need more beams to make it stronger
Maybe we should make it lower so it has less room to wiggle around
Maybe we should make it taller so it's bigger and stronger
No beams at the top part?
What about that beam across the middle?
one beam in the water?
One beam or do you think more?
People are gonna fall
Shoud it be like... more than one level high? Like multi-level?
So it can help support it
So the ground can help support it
So we're having a middle beam that goes across the whole thing?
So what if we do just one beam in the water?
So what if we do three beams in the water?
That would be a wall!
I think those beams have to be bigger to hold up those weights
They're probably gonna be stronger if they're bigger
three beams at the top part?
three beams in the water?
Wait can the bricks even go like that?!
"Wait, at the top or at the bottom?"
What about the boat?
That's gonna break
What if it's too tall and it falls over?
What if we connect the water beams to the land beams?
Will the middle part be strong enough?
Would that make one side stronger than the other?
Yeah it's gonna crash
Well maybe the middle bar can help it by� umm�.?
Well maybe more beams help� by� umm�.?
Well maybe the bigger base at the bottom could help by� um�
Maybe if it's just straight up then it'll... take up less room?
So you could have more beams then?
Maybe if we make the beams little then we could have more?
"Do you think it's better if we have more little beams or um, fewer thick beams?"
Do you think it's better if we keep the top part flat or if we have more blocks on it?
Maybe more blocks on the top can add extra strength
...Because it'll hold it together better?
I think there shouldn't be any extra weight to keep it strong
I think the people still need to walk across the top part
I think we need to figure out how to make sure the bridge isn't going to break when there's another weight bag on it
But we don't even know where they're gonna put the other bag�
It looks like it's going to break even with just one bag
My hypothesis is that the bridge will be strongest if we have strong beams on both sides and in the middle part
"because I think then it will be� more stable, and the bridge won't break"
"My hypothesis is also that the way to make the beams stronger is to um, first to make them really thick, like with a lot of bricks on them."
And the beams are also gonna be stronger if they're bigger at the base part� like a triangle
because then I think the base can make them more sturdy.
My other hypothesis is that the bridge would be even stronger if there were� supports connecting the middle part to the other beams.
Because this way the beams probably won't break and the bridge can stay up.
And my last hypothesis is that there shouldn't be a lot of extra weight at the top�
� because if there's more weight at the top than at the bottom than it can crash�
� so I think that the top should be strong and there should be supports that hold it up�
� but that there shouldn't be extra blocks on top of it because that will just add more weight.
So yeah the bridge should have a lot of thick supports that are all connected to each other and to the middle part.
And... that's all.
Probably money
Okay� so I think we have to talk about making it stronger so it can hold up another one of those weight bags�
